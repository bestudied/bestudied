    <h1 style="text-align: center;color: crimson;">CROP PRODUCTION AND THEIR MANAGEMENT</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">When plants of same kind cultivated at one place , it is called a <strong><em>Crop</em></strong>
       ..... For example : Wheat crop means that all the plant grown in the field are wheat . Crops are classified into 3 different types on the 
       basis of the seasons . They are : <br> <ol><li>Kharif crops</li><li>Rabi crops</li><li>Zaid crops</li></ol><br>
       
       <div>
      <ol><li> Kharif Crops :The crops which are sown  in  the  rainy  season  are  called kharif crops. The rainy season in Indiais  generally<br>  
        from June  to  September.Paddy,  maize, 
        soyabean,  groundnut,cotton, etc., are kharif crops.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Rabi Crops :The crops grown in thewinter  season  are  called  rabi  crops.Their  time  period  is  generally  
        fromOctober  to  March. <br> Examples  of  rabicrops  are  wheat,  gram,  pea,  mustardand linseed.Besides these, pulses and vegetablesare 
         grown  during  summer  at  manyplaces .</li>
         <br>
         <br>
         <li>Zaid crops : Zaid crops are summer season crops . They grow in long time period mainly from March to June.<br> 
         These crops are mainly grown in the summer season during a period called the "Zaid crop season." .<br>Some examples of Zaid crops are  
         pumpkin, cucumber, bitter groud.</li></ol>

         These  activities  or  tasks  are  referredto  as  agricultural  practices.  These activities are listed below.<br>
         <ol><li>Preparation of soil       </li>  <br>
         <li>Sowing                        </li>  <br>
         <li>Adding manure and fertilisers </li>  <br>
         <li>Irrigation                    </li>  <br>
         <li>Protecting from weeds         </li>  <br>
        <li>Harvesting                     </li>  <br>
        <li>Storage                        </li>  <br>
       
        
       <ul><li> <strong>Preparation of Soil</strong> : The preparation of soil is the first step before growing a crop. One of the most important tasks in 
        agriculture is to turn the  soil  and  loosen  it. <br>  This  allows  the roots to penetrate deep into the soil. The loose  soil  allows  
        the  roots  to  breathe easily even when they go deep into the soil. <br>
    
        The loosened soil helps in the growth of earthworms and microbes present in the soil.<br> 
        These organisms are friends of the farmer since they further turn and loosen  the  soil  and  add  humus  to  it</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Sowing</strong> : Sowing  is  the  most  important  part  ofcrop  production.  Before  sowing,  goodquality seeds are selected.<br>
             Good qualityseeds are clean and healthy seeds of agood variety. Farmers prefer to use seeds which giva high yield . <br>
            The hollow and damaged seeds will float in water but good seeds will sink in water . <br>
            This is a very good process of separation good and damaged seeds .</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Adding manure and fertilisers :</strong>The substances which are added to thesoil  in  the  form  of  nutrients  for  the healthy  growth  of  plants   
                are  called manure and fertilisers.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Irrigation </strong> : Irrigation is the artificial process of applying controlled amounts of water to land to 
                    assist in production of crops .<br> Irrigation helps to grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate disturbed
                     soils in dry areas and during periods of less than average rainfall. Irrigation also has other uses in crop production, 
                     including frost protection .</li>
                     <br>
                     <li><strong>Protecting from weeds</strong> : In  a  field  many  other  undesirableplants  may  grow  naturally  along  
                        withthe crop.<br> These undesirable plants arecalled weeds . The  removal  of  weeds  is  called weeding .<br> Weeding  is
                          necessary  since weeds compete with the crop plants forwater, nutrients, space and light.<br> Thus,they affect the growth 
                          of the crop.<br> Someweeds interfere even in harvesting and may  be  poisonous  for  animals  and human beings.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li><strong>Harvesting</strong> : Harvesting  of  a  crop  is  an  important task. <br> The  cutting  of  crop  after  it 
                             is mature  is  called  harvesting.<br>  In harvesting, crops are pulled out or cutclose to the ground.<br>
                              It usually takes 3to 4 months for a cereal crop to mature.</li>
        
<br>
         <li><strong>Storage</strong> : Storage of produce is an important task.If  the  crop  grains  are  to  be  kept  for longer time,
             they should be safe frommoisture,     insects,     rats     and microorganisms.  The  fresh  crop  hasmore  moisture.  
             If  freshly  harvested grains (seeds) are stored without drying,they  may  get  spoilt  or  attacked  by organisms, 
              losing  their  germination capacity.  Hence,  before  storing  them,the grains are properly dried in the sun to  reduce  the  
              moisture  in  them.  This prevents  the  attack  by  insect  pests,bacteria  and  fungi.  
              Farmers  store grains  in  jute  bags  or  metallic  bins.</li>
